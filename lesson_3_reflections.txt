- When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	+ I would want to use a remote repository when i work on an open source, project and work together with people,
    so i can keep updating my changes to the project.

- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	+ I might want to pull changes manually, rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with my repository,
	  because the remote repository might be the public and stable one, and the repository in the local is experimental one,
	  so i totally don't want to mess it up.
